  <h2>Chase Oaks Church would love to help support you.   We're praying regularly for all of the staff of Terrace. We'd also love to know more about what you might specifically like prayer for, and we'd love to hear if there's opportunities for us to work alongside you and boost what you're already doing such a good job with.  
<br/>
  <h2>My email is <a href="mailto:mlusby@gmail.com">mlusby@gmail.com</a> and I lead the volunteer connection to Terrace from Chase Oaks Church at Richardson.  I'd love the chance to hear from you, help find answers to any questions you might have, and get a better undertanding of anything related to Terrace Elementary.
